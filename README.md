**RAG Model for QA Bot**
This Python code implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model for a Question Answering (QA) bot. It leverages Pinecone for efficient vector storage and retrieval, and Cohere for generating informative and relevant responses. The code includes data preprocessing, embedding generation, Pinecone upsert, and RAG query processing.

Key Features:

Utilizes Pinecone for vector database and nearest neighbor search. Employs Cohere for text generation and embedding. Supports custom data preprocessing and query handling. Provides a flexible framework for building RAG-based QA systems. Usage:

Replace placeholders like "Don't use mine with your actual API keys. Adjust the dataset path and preprocessing logic to match your specific data. Customize the Pinecone index configuration and query parameters as needed. Run the code to interact with the QA bot and test its responses. Additional Notes:

Consider using a more robust text preprocessing pipeline if your data contains noise or requires advanced cleaning. Experiment with different Cohere models and parameters to fine-tune the generated responses. Explore other vector databases and language models to compare their performance. For production use, implement error handling and logging mechanisms to monitor the system's behavior.
